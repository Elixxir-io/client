	/* === Sending ========================================================== */
	/* The process of sending a file involves three main steps:
		1.  Upload the file to a new identity using Upload. It is added to the
			event model with the status SendProcessing.
		2.  Wait for the file to be marked as SendProcessingComplete in the
			event model and get the file info stored there.
		3.  Send the file info to the channel using Send.

	   When the file is uploaded, it is broken into individual, equal-length
	   parts and sent to a randomly generated ID. Every time one of these parts
	   is sent or received, it is reported on all registered
	   SentProgressCallbacks for that transfer.

	   A SentProgressCallback is registered on the initial upload. However, if
	   the client is closed and reopened, the callback must be registered again
	   using RegisterSentProgressCallback; otherwise, the continued progress of
	   the transfer will not be reported.
	*/

	// Upload starts uploading the file to a new ID that can be sent to the
	// specified channel when complete. To get progress information about the
	// upload, a SentProgressCallback must be registered. All errors returned on
	// the callback are fatal and the user must take action to either RetrySend
	// or CloseSend.
	//
	// The file is added to the event model at the returned file ID with the
	// status Uploading. Once the upload is complete, the file link is added to
	// the event model with the status Complete.
	//
	// The SentProgressCallback only indicates the progress of the file upload,
	// not the status of the file in the event model. You must rely on updates
	// from the event model to know when it can be retrieved.

	// Parameters:
	//   - fileData - File contents. Max size defined by MaxFileSize.
	//   - retry - The number of sending retries allowed on send failure (e.g.
	//     a retry of 2.0 with 6 parts means 12 total possible sends).
	//   - progressCB - A callback that reports the progress of the file upload.
	//     The callback is called once on initialization, on every progress
	//     update (or less if restricted by the period), or on fatal error.
	//   - period - A progress callback will be limited from triggering only
	//     once per period.
	//
	// Returns:

	// Parameters:

	//   - fileLink - JSON of FileLink stored in the event model.
	//   - fileName - Human-readable file name. Max length defined by
	//     MaxFileNameLen.
	//   - fileType - Shorthand that identifies the type of file. Max length
	//     defined by MaxFileTypeLen.
	//   - preview - A preview of the file data (e.g. a thumbnail). Max size
	//     defined by MaxPreviewSize.
	//   - validUntil - The duration that the file is available in the channel.

	/* === Receiving ======================================================== */

		2. Registering the file transfer and a progress callback with
		   HandleIncomingTransfer.
		3. Receiving transfer progress on the progress callback.
		4. Receiving the complete file using Receive once the callback says
		   the transfer is complete.

	   Once the file transfer manager has started, it will call the
	   ReceiveCallback for every new file transfer that is received. Once that
	   happens, a ReceivedProgressCallback must be registered using
	   RegisterReceivedProgressCallback to get progress updates on the transfer.

	   When the progress callback reports that the transfer is complete, the
	   full file can be retrieved using Receive.
