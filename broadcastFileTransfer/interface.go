	/* === Sending ========================================================== */
	/* The processes of sending a file involves four main steps:
		1. Set up a method to send initial file transfer details using SendNew.
		2. Sending the file using Send and register a progress callback.
		3. Receiving transfer progress on the progress callback.
		4. Closing a finished send using CloseSend.

	   Once the file is sent, it is broken into individual, equal-length parts
	   and sent to the recipient. Every time one of these parts arrives, it is
	   reported on all registered SentProgressCallbacks for that transfer.

	   A SentProgressCallback is registered on the initial send. However, if the
	   client is closed and reopened, the callback must be registered again
	   using RegisterSentProgressCallback, otherwise the continued progress of
	   the transfer will not be reported.

	   Once the SentProgressCallback returns that the file has completed
	   sending, the file can be closed using CloseSend. If the callback reports
	   an error, then the file should also be closed using CloseSend.
