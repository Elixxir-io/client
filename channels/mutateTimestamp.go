// mutateTimestamp is used to modify the the timestamps on all messages in a
// deterministic manner. This is because message ordering is done by timestamp
// and the timestamps come from the rounds, which means multiple messages can
// have the same timestamp due to being in the same round. The meaning of
// conversations can change depending on order, so while no explicit order
// can be discovered because to do so can leak potential ordering info for the
// mix, choosing an arbitrary order and having all clients agree will at least
// ensure that misunderstandings due to disagreements in order cannot occur
//
// In order to do this, this function mutates the timestamp of the round within
// +/- 5ms seeded based upon the message ID.
// It should be noted that this is only a reasonable assumption when the number
// of messages in a channel isn't too much. For example, under these conditions
// the birthday paradox of getting a collision if there are 10 messages for the
// channel in the same round is ~4*10^-6, but the chance if there are 50
// messages is 10^-4, and if the entire round is full of messages for the
// channel (1000 messages), .0487.

	// the fields do not align, so there is some bias towards some parts of the
