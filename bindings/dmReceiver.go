type DMReceiver interface {
	// Receive is called when a raw direct message is received
	// with unkown type. It may be called multiple times on the
	// same message. It is incumbent on the user of the API to
	// filter such called by message ID.
	//
	// The api user must interpret the message type and perform
	// their own message parsing.
	//
	// Parameters:
	//  - messageID - The bytes of the [dm.MessageID] of the received
	//    message.
	//  - nickname - The nickname of the sender of the message.
	//  - text - The bytes content of the message.
	//  - timestamp - Time the message was received; represented
	//    as nanoseconds since unix epoch.
	//  - partnerKey - The partners's Ed25519 public key. This is
	//    required to respond.
	//  - senderKey - The sender's Ed25519 public key.
	//  - dmToken - The senders direct messaging token. This is
	//    required to respond.
	//  - codeset - The codeset version.
	//  - lease - The number of nanoseconds that the message is valid for.
	//  - roundId - The ID of the round that the message was received on.
	//  - mType - the type of the message, always 1 for this call
	//  - status - the [dm.SentStatus] of the message.

	// Statuses will be enumerated as such:
	//  Sent      =  0
