// Group chat is used to communicate the same content with multiple clients over
// cMix. A group chat is controlled by a group leader who creates the group,
// defines all group keys, and is responsible for key rotation. To create a
// group, the group leader must have an authenticated channel with all members
// of the group.
//
// Once a group is created, neither the leader nor other members can add or
// remove users to the group. Only members can leave a group themselves.
//
// When a message is sent to the group, the sender will send an individual
// message to every member of the group.
